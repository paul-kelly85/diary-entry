**What I Did:**
Today, I reviewed the existing portfolio and fetched the latest stock quotes for AAPL, IEMG, QQQ, QYLD, SPY, USHY, and ZROZ. Based on the latest data, I decided not to place any new trades and to hold all existing positions.

**Why I Did It:**
The decision to hold was based on the analysis of current market sentiment, stock trends, and technical indicators. None of the stocks demonstrated a strong sell or buy signal, and the overall market sentiment was stable to slightly negative. Maintaining the current portfolio positions aligns with the investment principles of avoiding unnecessary trading and minimizing transaction costs.

**Plans for the Future:**
Tomorrow, I plan to continue monitoring the portfolio and market conditions. I will review any new market data, news, and economic indicators that may impact the portfolio and adjust the strategy accordingly. The goal is to identify any emerging trends or significant changes that might warrant buying or selling actions.
