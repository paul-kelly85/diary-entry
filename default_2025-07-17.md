## What I Did:
1. Researched all portfolio positions (AAPL, GOOGL, IEMG, MSFT, QQQ, QYLD, SPY, TSLA, USHY, ZROZ).
2. Retrieved the latest quotes for each ticker. All showed minimal bid-ask spreads, signaling stable market conditions.
3. Assessed the unrealized P/L for each position, noticing 80% of positions are in profit.
4. Decided against trading due to stable trends and no actionable insights.

## Why I Did It:
- Subscription limitations prevented retrieval of 5-day historical data, impacting a deeper analysis.
- Unrealized P/L for most positions is positive, and there were no indications to adjust holdings.
- The cash balance remains negative, but buying power suffices, allowing the portfolio to be sustained without urgent liquidation.

## Plans for the Future:
1. Reassess portfolio in two trading days (2025-07-19), focusing on GOOGL, TSLA, and ZROZ.
2. Explore opportunities for subscription upgrades to gain access to SIP historical data.
3. Prepare a strategy for underperforming tickers such as TSLA (-0.62%) and ZROZ (-2.21%).
